\title{A Computerized Adaptive Testing Survey (catSurv) Object}
\description{
Objects of class \code{Cat} are used in administering Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) Surveys.  These objects contain several pieces of information relevent for CAT surveys, and are used as input in the main functions of the \code{catSurv} package. They are created using the \code{initialize} function.
}
\details{
Assume we have a survey battery with \code{I} questions.  An object of the class \code{Cat} has the following slots:
\itemize{
\item \code{guessing} A named vector of length \code{I} of guessing parameters.  Note: guessing parameters are only applicable for binary \code{Cat} objects. 
\item \code{discrimination} A named vector of length \code{I} of disrimination parameters.
\item \code{difficulty} A named vector or list of length \code{I} of difficulty parameters. For binary \code{Cat} objects, the vector will contain difficulty parameters for each item.  For categorical \code{Cat} objects, a list will constain a vector for each item, and each vector will contain a difficulty parameter for each response option.  
\item \code{answers} A named vector of length \code{I} of answers to questions as given by the survey respondent.  Unanswered questions have the value \code{NA}.
\item \code{priorName} A character vector of length one giving the prior distribution to use for the latent trait estimates.  The options are \code{NORMAL} for the normal distirbution, \code{STUDENT_T} for the student's t distribution, and \code{UNIFORM} for the uniform distribution.  
\item \code{priorParams} A numeric vector of length two of parameters for the distribution specified in the \code{priorName} slot. See 'details' for more information.
\item \code{lowerBound} A numeric indicating the lower bound of the interval of the latent scale used in estimation. The default value is \eqn{-6}.
\item \code{upperBound} A numeric indicating the upper bound of the interval of the latent scale used in estimation. The default value is \eqn{6}.
\item \code{poly} A logical containing the type of answers.  TRUE indicates categorical response options, FALSE indicates binary response options.  Default is TRUE.
\item \code{estimation} A character vector of length one indicating the choice of approach to estimate ability parameters.  The options are \code{EAP}, \code{MAP}, \code{MLE}, and \code{WLE}.
\item \code{estimationDefault} A character vector of length one indicating the choice of approach to estimate ability parameters when the primary estimation choice indicating in the \code{estimation} slot fails to converge.  The options are \code{EAP} and \code{MAP}.
\item \code{selection} A character vector of length one indicating the choice of approach select the next item.  The options are \code{EPV}, \code{MEI}, \code{MFI}, \code{MPWI}, \code{MLWI}, \code{KL}, \code{LKL}, \code{PKL}, \code{MFII}, and \code{RANDOM}.
\item \code{z} A numeric.  Used in calculating delta, which is used in calculating the bounds of integration for some \code{selectItem} methods.  See 'details' for more information.
\item \code{lengthThreshold} A numeric.  The number of questions answered must be greater than or equal to this threshold.
\item \code{seThreshold} A numeric.  The standard error estimate of the latent trait must be less than this threshold.
\item \code{infoThreshold} A numeric.  The Fisher's information for all remaining items must be less than this threshold.
\item \code{gainThreshold} A numeric.  The absolute value of the difference between the standard error of the latent trait estimate and the square root of the expected posterior variance for each item must be less than this threshold.
\item \code{lengthOverride} A numeric.  The number of questions answered must be less than this override.
\item \code{gainOverride} A numeric.  The absolute value of the difference between the standard error of the latent trait estimate and the square root of the expected posterior variance for each item must be less than this override.  
}

When \code{priorName} is set to "NORMAL", the first element of \code{priorParams} is the mean, the second element is the standard deviation.  When \code{priorName} is set to "STUDENT_T", the first element of \code{priorParam} is mu, a location parameter, the second is degrees of freedom.  When \code{priorName} is set to "UNIFORM", the elements of \code{priorParams} are lower and upper, respectively.  Note that the uniform distribution is only applicable for the "EAP" estimation method.  

Talk about 'z' and how it's used to calculate delta.

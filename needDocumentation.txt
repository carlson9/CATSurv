## datasets — I suspect when we remade the package in the R class, the .Rd files for ‘nfc’ and ’npi’ were copies, instead of properly made through roxygen.  So there is no proper way to edit them.  What needs to be done: the documentation for these datasets needs to be added to the R/datasets.R file, following the example of the ‘polknow’ dataset documentation already in that file.

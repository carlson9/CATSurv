## makeTree — clean

## plot functions
haven’t looked at them in ages

## is there an MFII selection method??

## GPCM new dataset and fit
—> eRm package

## tpmcat
Do I need to be testing it as well?  Same as binary but with guessing?


## get & set methods — cleaned, now adds quick tests



## we need to check what happens when there’s a tie for max or min estimate for nextItem routines.
— it’s just the first one
- it does this because it compares the following to see if its > or < than current min or max value — document this!









## Tests
- this is not a problem with catSurv… calculating the standard error with the ltm package and MAP is very different (might be something wrong with their math)
- I should go back and add a test of each function with extreme theta values — either it works or throws error — make sure it does not crash R


## Other things I’m realizing while testing
- make answers stay length it should be… you shouldn’t be able to change the length.
- fisherInf and obsInf… when is fisherInf called? Is the obsInf error inappropriate?
- what catR returns for ltm nextItem ‘info’ (what the estimate for that item is) is wrong for EPV.  It doesn’t match the EPV function.
- add tests to make sure probabilities for GPCM cats sum to 1 after I add in checks for crazy numerators and denominator

makeTree
- You should be able to feed it a list of lists and have it change the object to a table.  Right now you have to re-run the entire function with the Cat object to make a table!  This is really a quick matter of making a new method…

probability
- example for gpcm

library(catSurv)
— print the grant number 


Documentation consistency:
- not all caps in short title
- in short description, make sure to say “estimate” or “calculate” correctly
- in short description, no period at the end
- ability parameter
- question item/item
- no period at the end of descriptions
- left math for probability and selectItem and checkStopRules

Cat class:
- what should MFII short name be?


main.cpp:
- When integration is used (estimateTheta), make sure to note in those functions that lowerBound and upperBound will be used.
- fix estimationDefault
- In selectItem note which options will use lowerBound and upperBound, and which functions will use z.



Other
- try to change probability from NumericVector/IntegerVector to scalars so it can’t take a vector and just use the first element




## GPCM new dataset and fit
—> eRm package

## tpmcat — add selectItem tests??




## we need to check what happens when there’s a tie for max or min estimate for nextItem routines.
— it’s just the first one
- it does this because it compares the following to see if its > or < than current min or max value — document this!






## Tests
- this is not a problem with catSurv… calculating the standard error with the ltm package and MAP is very different (might be something wrong with their math)
- I should go back and add a test of each function with extreme theta values — either it works or throws error — make sure it does not crash R


## Other things I’m realizing while testing
- make answers stay length it should be… you shouldn’t be able to change the length.
- fisherInf and obsInf… when is fisherInf called? Is the obsInf error inappropriate?
- what catR returns for ltm nextItem ‘info’ (what the estimate for that item is) is wrong for EPV.  It doesn’t match the EPV function.
- add tests to make sure probabilities for GPCM cats sum to 1 after I add in checks for crazy numerators and denominator

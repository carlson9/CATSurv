probability
- example for gpcm

library(catSurv)
— print the grant number 


Documentation consistency:
- not all caps in short title
- in short description, make sure to say “estimate” or “calculate” correctly
- in short description, no period at the end
- ability parameter
- question item/item
- no period at the end of descriptions

- left math for probability and selectItem


Other
— make sure that user can feed other arguments to grmCat, etc… (like start.val)
- try to change probability from NumericVector/IntegerVector to scalars so it can’t take a vector and just use the first element



## makeTree — clean — done

## plot functions
haven’t looked at them in ages

## GPCM new dataset and fit
—> eRm package

## tpmcat — add selectItem tests??

## get & set methods — cleaned, now adds quick tests



## we need to check what happens when there’s a tie for max or min estimate for nextItem routines.
— it’s just the first one
- it does this because it compares the following to see if its > or < than current min or max value — document this!






## Tests
- this is not a problem with catSurv… calculating the standard error with the ltm package and MAP is very different (might be something wrong with their math)
- I should go back and add a test of each function with extreme theta values — either it works or throws error — make sure it does not crash R


## Other things I’m realizing while testing
- make answers stay length it should be… you shouldn’t be able to change the length.
- fisherInf and obsInf… when is fisherInf called? Is the obsInf error inappropriate?
- what catR returns for ltm nextItem ‘info’ (what the estimate for that item is) is wrong for EPV.  It doesn’t match the EPV function.
- add tests to make sure probabilities for GPCM cats sum to 1 after I add in checks for crazy numerators and denominator

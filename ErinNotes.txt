## Dataset Documentation
I suspect when we remade the package in the R class, the .Rd files for ‘nfc’ and ’npi’ were copies, instead of properly made through roxygen.  So, there is no proper way to edit them.  What needs to be done: the documentation for these datasets needs to be added to the R/datasets.R file, following the example of the ‘polknow’ dataset documentation already in that file.

## GRM probability
Is it alright to print the probability bounded by 0 and 1?  I did it to streamline functionality in c++ code.  I think it helps make clear that these are outpoints and NOT actually category probabilities.

## GPCM dataset/convergence warning
Do we want to add a different dataset to the package for gpcm?  Right now I use nfc to create a gpcm cat to test with.  Along those lines, the ltm package’s gpcm() function never converges, but I just have these objects already made and load them in, instead of sourcing in the code… it takes way too long to do so.

## Tests
- We need to think of weird things that might happen to probability and add test for those. Right now its basic tests.
- usePrior in dLL and d2LL is not being tested yet
- dLL and d2LL are only very basic tests so far
- this is not a problem with catSurv… calculating the standard error with the ltm package and MAP is very different (might be something wrong with their math)
- add tests to estimateTheta methods for when no questions have been answered.
- I should go back and add a test of each function with extreme theta values — either it works or throws error — make sure it does not crash R

## Other things I’m realizing while testing
- Make ‘prior’ function private? Has no need to be visible
- make answers stay length it should be… you shouldn’t be able to change the length.
- expectedKL is not working!! test against catIrt — when testing, change delta in the Estimator.cpp file
- catIrt is a dependency for testing purposes… need to have it installed
- fisherInf and obsInf… when is fisherInf called? Is the obsInf error inappropriate?
- what catR returns for ltm nextItem ‘info’ (what the estimate for that item is) is wrong for EPV.  It doesn’t match the EPV function.
- add tests to make sure probabilities for GPCM cats sum to 1 after I add in checks for crazy numerators and denominator
- we need to check what happens when there’s a tie for max or min estimate for nextItem routines.


## Old problems
Right now the Brent method has initial search interval set at [-5,5] because it was crashing R on the test dataset when set at [-6,6].  We need it to send an error/not crash when set at [-6,6].

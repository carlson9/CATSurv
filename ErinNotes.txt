storeAnswer and setAnswers
- I feel like we don’t need both.  I think we should get rid of storeAnswer, but change how setAnswers works so it works like storeAnswer.  Then we need to change the function used in makeTree.  There’s also just a few instances where we use setAnswers in the examples.

models
- Change so that models are all CAPS.  Then change documentation as well.

library(catSurv)
— print the grant number 

selectItem
- go back and add in details about setting integration bounds (which criterion need this?)  Are there any criterion that need certain priors or estimation methods?


Documentation consistency:
- in short description, make sure to say “estimate” or “calculate” correctly
- in short description, no period at the end
- ability parameter
- question item/item
- left math for probability and selectItem and checkStopRules

Cat class:
- what should MFII short name be?


main.cpp:
- When integration is used (estimateTheta), make sure to note in those functions that lowerBound and upperBound will be used.
- fix estimationDefault
- In selectItem note which options will use lowerBound and upperBound, and which functions will use z.




## GPCM new dataset and fit
—> eRm package

## tpmcat — add selectItem tests??







## Tests
- this is not a problem with catSurv… calculating the standard error with the ltm package and MAP is very different (might be something wrong with their math)
- I should go back and add a test of each function with extreme theta values — either it works or throws error — make sure it does not crash R


## Other things I’m realizing while testing
- make answers stay length it should be… you shouldn’t be able to change the length.
- fisherInf and obsInf… when is fisherInf called? Is the obsInf error inappropriate?
- what catR returns for ltm nextItem ‘info’ (what the estimate for that item is) is wrong for EPV.  It doesn’t match the EPV function.
- add tests to make sure probabilities for GPCM cats sum to 1 after I add in checks for crazy numerators and denominator

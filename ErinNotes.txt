## Dataset Documentation
I suspect when we remade the package in the R class, the .Rd files for ‘nfc’ and ’npi’ were copies, instead of properly made through roxygen.  So, there is no proper way to edit them.  What needs to be done: the documentation for these datasets needs to be added to the R/datasets.R file, following the example of the ‘polknow’ dataset documentation already in that file.



## is there an MFII selection method??


## GPCM dataset/convergence warning
Do we want to add a different dataset to the package for gpcm?  Right now I use nfc to create a gpcm cat to test with.  Along those lines, the ltm package’s gpcm() function never converges, but I just have these objects already made and load them in, instead of sourcing in the code… it takes way too long to do so.

## tpmcat
Do I need to be testing it as well?  Same as binary but with guessing?


## skipping
I added in tests for that at the estimateTheta and nextItem levels


## get & set methods
Are they needed? - yes


## poly vs. modelFit slot — model
Can i get rid of poly?  I needed something for gpcm, so I don’t use it anymore




## have all validity and errors about what you can do to CAT object in the cat-class file



## we need to check what happens when there’s a tie for max or min estimate for nextItem routines.
— it’s just the first one
- it does this because it compares the following to see if its > or < than current min or max value









## Tests
- this is not a problem with catSurv… calculating the standard error with the ltm package and MAP is very different (might be something wrong with their math)
- I should go back and add a test of each function with extreme theta values — either it works or throws error — make sure it does not crash R

## Other things I’m realizing while testing
- make answers stay length it should be… you shouldn’t be able to change the length.
- fisherInf and obsInf… when is fisherInf called? Is the obsInf error inappropriate?
- what catR returns for ltm nextItem ‘info’ (what the estimate for that item is) is wrong for EPV.  It doesn’t match the EPV function.
- add tests to make sure probabilities for GPCM cats sum to 1 after I add in checks for crazy numerators and denominator



## Old problems
Right now the Brent method has initial search interval set at [-5,5] because it was crashing R on the test dataset when set at [-6,6].  We need it to send an error/not crash when set at [-6,6]. — I think I solved this with the “extreme theta value” error in probability
